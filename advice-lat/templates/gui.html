            <p><a style="font-weight:bold;">Road Deterioration Identification and Prediction</a>: The challenge facing 
              many local authorities is perennially underfunded budgets and few funding 
              prospects. The only path forward is to do more with existing budgets, 
              particularly in proactive and preventative road repairs. As with healthcare, 
              prevention is the best treatment. Earlier road repairs prior to larger and 
              more comprehensive repairs are proven to extend the useful life of roads 
              while saving up to 30% of costs (Asphalt Industry Alliance).</p>

              platform gathers road condition data and enables local governments to create micro-PPPs. This 
              creates employment, reduces repair costs, and enables local participation in public works projects 
              by reducing utilization of heavily equipped contractors. Their software enables road maintenance 
              repairs using just a shovel and a cellphone. Improving access to health, education, markets,

          <p>The <a style="font-weight:bold;">Advanced Aerospace Technology Center (CATEC)</a>, implemented 
            and managed by the Andalusian Foundation for Aerospace Development (FADA), is a center of 
            excellence that acts as an interface between the agents of the Science, Technology and Enterprise 
            system. One of its objectives is to meet the R&D&I demand of the more than 110 companies that make 
            up the Andalusian aeronautical industrial fabric and other national and international companies, 
            transferring knowledge and technology to them in their corresponding fields of application.

          <p><a style="font-weight:bold;">ADVICE</a>, will increase the resilience of the road maintenance 
            EU infrastructure, advising to minimize full-road maintenance actions and early detecting hazards 
            for drivers through the combination of Deep Learning algorithms with imagery and sparse telemetry 
            traffic datasets to early trigger road maintenance. </p>
            <p>Around 25% of public Investment in EU is dedicated to transport investments (Road 
            Transport report, 2/2019). A short-term consequence of a close monitoring of roads is an increase in 
            workload for contractors and outsourced SMEs destinated to such reparations. 
            At a second level, early maintenance actions are demonstrated to be more efficient than simple 
            reactive reparations. This better performance directly relates to a reduction in greenhouse gases by 
            up to 2% and decreases of driver's fuel consumption by 2% to 5% (benefits of road maintenance, RSTA 
            organization)</p>
            <p>As the experiments advanced, we detected that this given dataset was, sometimes, mislabeled. This 
              could negativately affect the final result of the project.This Label Assistant Tool aims to improve 
              the raw dataset through the inclussion or exclussion of the predicted label of our AI system in an 
              improved second version dataset. </p>
